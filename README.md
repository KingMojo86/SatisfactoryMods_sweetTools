# SatisfactoryMods_sweetTools
This is a collection of tools (sweetTools) for our local games.  We offer no real support for any of this but do offer almost all source so you can do what you want with it.

NOTE: ALL MODS REQUIRE sweetToolsBase.pak and .sig.  Without them you are doomed to failure.

If you are just here for the mod Paks then check out the Paks folder.  

If you want source check out the ModSource Folder.  It replicates the Unreal directory structure so you can just drop them in a project (probably).
